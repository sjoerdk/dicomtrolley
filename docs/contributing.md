  ```
### Publish

### Incrementing the version number
A merged pull request will only be published to pypi if it has a new version number. 
To bump dicomtrolley's version, do the following:

* dicomtrolley uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) Check whether your addition is a PATCH, MINOR or MAJOR version.

* Manually increment the version number: `pyproject.toml` -> `version = "0.1.2"`
  
* Add a brief description of your updates new version to `HISTORY.md`

### Updating docs
Docs are based on [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), using the 
[Materials for mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) skin.

Docs are published on [readthedocs.org](https://about.readthedocs.com/). Docs requirements are kept separate and updated with 
[pip-tools](https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools/) for a clean readthedocs build. To edit the docs:

* Install docs dependencies: `pip install -r docs/docs_requirements.txt`

* Edit content in `/docs`, potentialy add requirements in `docs/docs_requirements.in`

* Try out your changes using `mkdocs serve`

* Update docs requirements (readthedocs needs this): `pip-compile docs/docs_requirements.in`
